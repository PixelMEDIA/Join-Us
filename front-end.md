# So, you're interested in working at [PixelMEDIA](http://www.pixelmedia.com/)! 

### We appreciate your interest, and we'd love to talk to you.



If you're looking at one of our openings which involves front-end interface development, one of the things we've been asking folks to do is code up a sample page to show us their skills. 


Here's [a link to a zip file with two PSD’s](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24980173/Dev%20Test.zip) of the same page, one is a desktop layout and one is a mobile view of the same page. We’d like to see what you can come up with! While it’s certainly not a requirement to code out the entire layout, we are looking for enough of it to give us a feel for your coding style and how you structure your code. Use this to showcase your skills! Keep in mind that while we enjoy the latest technology as much as the next developer, we also need to make sure our client work is accessible and cross browser compatible. 


The layout of the page should hopefully be pretty self explanatory. The section labeled “Advantages” in the PSD shows one of the circles a bit larger and purple, and that’s the hover state. 
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us through [Twitter](http://twitter.com/pixelmedia) or  [Facebook](http://facebook.com/pixelmediafb). <sup>1</sup>

When you're finished, send a link to the finished product in your cover letter and submit your resume through [our website](http://www.pixelmedia.com/careers).<sup>2</sup>

Looking forward to hearing from you!
